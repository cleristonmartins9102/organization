### **Sprints**

Sprints organize and manage Stories for a specific period. When the **Finish button** is clicked, several automated actions are triggered:

- **Archived Status**: Done Tasks, completed Stories, and finished Epics are moved to “Archived.”
- **Carryover**: Any Story with unfinished Tasks or open Epics is returned to the Backlog for reassignment.
- **Effort Calculation**: Calculates effort for remaining Stories based on Task weights, contributing to the Sprint’s burn-down tracking.

### **Tasks**

Tasks are the smallest and most specific work items on this board. Each Task is linked to a Story and has a **Status** property (To Do, In Progress, Done, Archived), used to track the progress of Stories and Epics. The weight of each Task can be adjusted with a **multiplier** (0.5 to 5) to determine its impact on Story effort calculations. When a Sprint is completed, all “Done” Tasks are moved to “Archived.”

### **Stories**

Stories are actionable units that break down Epics and are connected to multiple Tasks. Each Story’s status is formula-driven, dynamically updating based on the statuses of its Tasks:

- **Backlog**: All Tasks are in the Backlog.
- **To Do**: All Tasks are in “To Do” or a mix of “Backlog” and “To Do.”
- **In Progress**: At least one Task is marked “In Progress.”
When creating a new Story, you can apply the ‘New Sprint’ tag. This tag automatically moves the Story to “To Do” in the new Sprint upon closing the current one. The Story’s total effort is calculated based on Task weights.

### **Epics**

Epics are overarching objectives made up of multiple Stories. Each Epic’s status is managed automatically, monitoring the status of its Stories. When all Stories are completed, the Epic moves to “Archived.” If at least one Story is still active, the Epic’s status reflects “In Progress” or “To Do.” Epics are automatically updated based on the completion of their Stories, providing a high-level overview of broader goals.
